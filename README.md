App Idea
I would like to build a music app where musicians can scan or take a photo of the actual music and the app converts it into pdf and plays through the music so the performer can hear how the music is supposed to sound and how the correct rhythm is supposed to sound. This is because, as a flutist myself, I have been in many scenarios where, I am given music to play and sometimes the rhythm is difficult to figure out on my own and I end up learning the wrong thing only to be corrected later. I also discovered once a musician hears how a song is supposed to sound, it becomes so much easier to learn the music score. Hence, I want to create an app that plays through music for musicians and they can stop and re-play certain sections if they want. I wanted to integrate an AI part as well where one can record themselves playing and receive recommendations from the AI on technical exercises to practice.
